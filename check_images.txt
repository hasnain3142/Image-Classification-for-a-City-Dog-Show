4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Each model architecture correctly classified all the four uploaded images correctly but the elapsed time for vgg was 3 seconds while for AlexNet and ResNet it was nearly zero, so I will select AlexNet because this architecture can classify "dogs" and "not-a-dog" at 100% accuracy.
